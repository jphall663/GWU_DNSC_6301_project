### Training Data

* Data dictionary: 

| Name | Modeling Role | Measurement Level| Description|
| ---- | ------------- | ---------------- | ---------- |
|**ID**| ID | int | unique row indentifier |
| **LIMIT_BAL** | input | float | amount of previously awarded credit |
| **SEX** | demographic information | int | 1 = male; 2 = female
| **RACE** | demographic information | int | 1 = hispanic; 2 = black; 3 = white; 4 = asian |
| **EDUCATION** | demographic information | int | 1 = graduate school; 2 = university; 3 = high school; 4 = others |

| **AGE** | demographic information | int | age in years |
| **PAY_0, PAY_2 - PAY_6** | inputs | int | history of past payment; PAY_0 = the repayment status in September, 2005; PAY_2 = the repayment status in August, 2005; ...; PAY_6 = the repayment status in April, 2005. The measurement scale for the repayment status is: -1 = pay duly; 1 = payment delay for one month; 2 = payment delay for two months; ...; 8 = payment delay for eight months; 9 = payment delay for nine months and above |
| **BILL_AMT1 - BILL_AMT6** | inputs | float | amount of bill statement; BILL_AMNT1 = amount of bill statement in September, 2005; BILL_AMT2 = amount of bill statement in August, 2005; ...; BILL_AMT6 = amount of bill statement in April, 2005 |
| **PAY_AMT1 - PAY_AMT6** | inputs | float | amount of previous payment; PAY_AMT1 = amount paid in September, 2005; PAY_AMT2 = amount paid in August, 2005; ...; PAY_AMT6 = amount paid in April, 2005 |
| **DELINQ_NEXT**| target | int | whether a customer's next payment is delinquent (late), 1 = late; 0 = on-time |

### Quantitative Analysis

* Models were assessed primarily with AUC and AIR. See details below:

| Train AUC | Validation AUC | Test AUC |
| ------ | ------- | -------- |
| 0.3456 | 0.7891  | 0.7687* |

Table 1. AUC values across data partitions. 

| Group | Validation AIR |
|-------|-----|
| Black vs. White | 0.8345 |
| Hispanic vs. White | 0.8765 |
| Asian vs. White | 1.098 |
| Female vs. Male | 1.245 |
